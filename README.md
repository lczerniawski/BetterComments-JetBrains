The **Better Comments** plugin enhances commenting capabilities within JetBrains IDEs, allowing developers to create organized and visually distinct comments. This improvement in clarity and readability aids in understanding and maintaining code.

This plugin is inspired by the [Better Comments extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments), aiming to provide JetBrains users with similar functionality for better code documentation.

## Key Features

- **Color-Coded Comments**: Use predefined tags such as `TODO`, `?`, `!`, `//`, and `*` to categorize comments by color, enhancing visibility and organization.
- **Custom Tag Addition**: Users can add their own tags, allowing for personalized comment styles tailored to specific project needs.
- **Improved Readability**: Distinct comment styles contribute to clearer code comprehension, making it easier for teams to collaborate.
- **Wide Compatibility**: Compatible with all JetBrains IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm.

After installing the Better Comments plugin, users can add comments in their code using the supported tags. For example, prefixing a comment with `// TODO:` or `!` automatically applies the designated color coding. Additionally, users have the ability to define and add their own tags to suit their workflow.
